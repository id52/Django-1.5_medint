Medical+Intelligence believes that individual health outcomes can be optimized through better medical decisions based on the best available evidence, inference and reasoning. </h4>
    <div class="grid_3">
    <p>As a result, patients will build closer relationships with their doctors, have more involvement and control over their specific conditions, and carry out day-by-day actions to improve and extend their lives.<br/>At no cost to the primary physician, we provide platforms that allow medical professionals to easily access relevant current and established data – as well asthe newest research findings as they are published, filtered by priority – for the diseases and disorders that most affect the lives of their patients.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid_3">
        <p>And we accelerate the utilization of evidence-based diagnostic and monitoring tools for better patient outcomes using applications that can be accessed by the doctor/patient team – on the computer in your office, or just about anywhere using a smartphone or tablet. These new technologies provide information on an "as-needed" basis, encourage communication and feedback, and improve physician and patient decision-making, freeing both from the traditional barriers to getting the appropriate care and treatment.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid_3" style="margin-right:0">
        <p>Our mission at Medical+Intelligence is to work in partnership with doctors, providing them the technology and human resources they need to offer more specialized healthcare. This in turn creates a deeper doctor-patient relationship and, for the patient, confidence that they truly are getting a superior level of personalized medicine.</p>
